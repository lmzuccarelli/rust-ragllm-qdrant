# What is a qubit

In quantum computing, a qubit or quantum bit is a basic unit of quantum informationâ€”the quantum version of the classic binary bit physically realized with a two-state device. 
A qubit is a two-state (or two-level) quantum-mechanical system, one of the simplest quantum systems displaying the peculiarity of quantum mechanics. 
Examples include the spin of the electron in which the two levels can be taken as spin up and spin down; or the polarization of a single photon in which the two spin 
states (left-handed and the right-handed circular polarization) can also be measured as horizontal and vertical linear polarization. 
In a classical system, a bit would have to be in one state or the other. However, quantum mechanics allows the qubit to be in a coherent superposition of multiple states simultaneously, 
a property that is fundamental to quantum mechanics and quantum computing.
